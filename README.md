# Features
This weather app provides users with current weather information for their selected location. In addition to the basic weather data points, the OpenWeather API provides additional functionalities that can be incorporated into the app, such as hourly or daily forecasts, historical weather data, and UV index information.

# Error Handling
The app has error handling to ensure that users input a valid location and to handle any errors that may occur during the API call. If the user inputs an invalid location or there is an issue with the API call, the app will display an error message indicating that there was an issue with the request.
